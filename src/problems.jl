    ProblemSpec

Specification of an example problem to be benchmarked. It bundles everything the
benchmark harness needs to build and assess a problem at an arbitrary floating
point precision `T`, keeping the harness itself independent of any particular
problem from `GeometricProblems.jl`.

# Fields
- `name::String`: human readable problem name (used for labelling and file names).
- `builder`: callable `T -> problem` returning an `ODEProblem` at precision `T`.
- `energy`: callable `(t, q, p, params) -> H` computing the conserved energy /
  invariant from the positions `q` and momenta `p`. Used as an accuracy proxy
  (energy drift). `p` is `nothing` for problems whose solution carries no separate
  momentum (an `ODEProblem` state already bundles both into `q`); Hamiltonians
  that depend on positions alone simply ignore the argument.
- `reference`: callable `(t, x₀, params) -> x` giving the analytic solution at
  time `t`, or `nothing` when no closed-form solution is available.
- `f_abstol_factor::Float64`: the nonlinear solver's absolute residual tolerance
  is `f_abstol_factor * eps(T)`. Defaults to `8` (the integrator's own default).
  Larger-scale Hamiltonian systems whose residual floor sits well above
  `8 eps(T)` (e.g. the double pendulum, whose forces are `O(g m l)`) need a
  looser tolerance, otherwise the solver iterates against an unreachable target
  and is spuriously reported as non-converged.

Return a [`ProblemSpec`](@ref) for the 2d Lotka–Volterra system from

ODE / degenerate Lagrangian form). This is a nonlinear, non-canonical Hamiltonian
system; its Hamiltonian `H = a₁q₁ + a₂q₂ + b₁\\log q₁ + b₂\\log q₂` depends on the
positions `q` alone, and is used for the energy-drift accuracy metric.

The default time span/step are the problem's native `(0, 10)` with `Δt = 0.01`
(1000 steps): the coarse `Δt = 0.1` used for the oscillator/pendulum is too large
for this stiffer system.

Return a [`ProblemSpec`](@ref) for the 4d Lotka–Volterra system from
`GeometricProblems.LotkaVolterra4d`, built as an **`iodeproblem`**. Like the 2d
case it is a non-canonical Hamiltonian system with
`H = a·q + b·\\log q` (positions only), used for the energy-drift metric. It is
more strongly degenerate than the 2d system and is a demanding test for the
nonlinear solvers — low precision typically fails with a singular Jacobian.

Return a [`ProblemSpec`](@ref) for the double pendulum from
`GeometricProblems.DoublePendulum`, built as an **`hodeproblem`** (canonical
Hamiltonian form). This is a chaotic, strongly nonlinear system, so it exercises
the nonlinear solvers hard. Its Hamiltonian `H(t, q, p)` depends on **both** the
generalized coordinates `q` and the momenta `p`, so the energy proxy is evaluated
from the full `(q, p)` state. No closed-form solution exists; accuracy is
assessed through the energy drift.

The default initial conditions and parameters are the problem's own module
defaults; the native time span is `(0, 10)` with the standard `Δt = 0.01`
(a coarse `Δt = 0.1` is used as a second scenario).

Because the double pendulum's forces are `O(g m l)`, its nonlinear residual
bottoms out around `10² eps(T)` rather than `eps(T)`, so the solver's residual
tolerance is relaxed to `256 eps(T)` (`f_abstol_factor = 256`); with the default
`8 eps(T)` even a fully solved step is reported as non-converged (and at
`Float32` no configuration converges at all).

Return a [`ProblemSpec`](@ref) for the Toda lattice from
`GeometricProblems.TodaLattice`, built as an **`hodeproblem`** with `N = 16`
lattice sites. The full soliton example uses `N = 200`, which would make the
implicit solves prohibitively expensive for a solver benchmark, so a modest
`N = 16` is used here. The lattice size is passed positionally to `hodeproblem`;
the initial positions come from `compute_initial_q(μ, N)` (a bump of width `μ`)
with zero initial momenta. Its Hamiltonian `H(t, q, p, N)` depends on both `q`
and `p` (and on `N`, which the energy closure captures). No closed-form solution
exists; accuracy is assessed through the energy drift.

The native time span `(0, 120)` is shortened to `(0, 100)` with the standard
`Δt = 0.1`; a coarse `Δt = 1.0` is used as a second scenario. As for the double
pendulum the residual tolerance is relaxed to `256 eps(T)`
(`f_abstol_factor = 256`), which also lets more configurations converge at
`Float16`.
